Exercise-1: Answer the following questions about this code block: 

const isLearning = true;
if(isLearning){
    console.log("Keep Learning");
} else {
    console.log("I hope you are learning....");
}

What should the above code console.log?


Exercise-2:Why do we not need to specify if(isLearning === true)? 
Why does if(isLearning) work on its own?


Exercise-3:
Use both if and switch statement
====================================================
age: less then 10  
output: stay home under your mom supervision

age: more and equal then 10 and less then 15 
 output: Try to gain knowledge from outside of home

age: more then and equal to 15 and less than 18
output: prepare to cast vote

age: more or equal then 18 
 output: cast you vote

age: unknown
  output: You are out of range



Exercise-4:
let var1;
const var2 = "";
const var3 = 1;
const secretMessage = "secret!";

if(var1){
    console.log("first");
} else if(var1 || var2){
    console.log("second");
} else if(var1 || var3){
    console.log("third");
} else {
    console.log("fourth");
}
What should the above code console.log? Why? 

What is the value of var1 when it is initialized? 
Is the value of var1 a "truthy" value? Why? 
Is the value of var2 a "truthy" value? Why? 
Is the value of var3 a "truthy" value? Why?


Exercise-5:
Choose the correct conditional (ternary) operator to console  "Too young" if age is less than 18, otherwise alert "Old enough" 


Exercise-6:When to Use if else vs ternary vs switch?
