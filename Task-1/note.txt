Exercise 1: Declare Personal Information
You are introducing yourself to an interview board. Create five variables that store the following information about you:

name: A string with your name (e.g., "Samim")

email: A string with your email address

age: A number representing your age

isDeveloper: A boolean value indicating whether you are a developer

goingToBeDesigner: Assign a clearly negative or null-ish value (e.g., null, undefined)

ðŸ“Œ Follow best practices: use proper variable naming, choose the right declaration keyword (let or const), and maintain readability.

Exercise 2: Construct and Print a Sentence
Using the variables from Exercise 1, form a sentence that introduces you. Your sentence should look like:

Hey it's me "<name>". I am <age>. You can contact me by this <email>. I am a Developer and it's <isDeveloper>. I am going to be a Designer - <goingToBeDesigner>

Print this sentence using string concatenation

Print it again using template string syntax

Exercise 3: Variable Overwriting

Try declaring multiple variables with the same name in the same scope using let, const, and var.

What happens when you try to redeclare a variable?

Which declaration style allows overwriting?

Which one throws an error?

Exercise 4: Difference Between null and undefined
Explain the difference between the values null and undefined in JavaScript.

How is each value created?

What do they represent?

How are they treated by JavaScript?

Exercise 5: Understanding NaN
What is NaN in JavaScript?

When does it occur?

What is the result of using typeof on NaN?

Exercise 6: Declaring a Variable Without a Value
What happens if you declare a variable without assigning it any value?
Example: let thing;

What will be the value of thing?

Why does it behave that way?
