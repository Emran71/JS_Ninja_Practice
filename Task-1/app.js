//Exercise 1:
let myName = "Emran Khan";
let email = 'ekhan4475@gmail.com';
let age =28;
let isDeveloper =true;
let goingToBeDesigner =null;

//  Exercise 2:

console.log("Hey it's me",myName,"I am" ,age, "years old. You can contact me by this", email,".I am a Developer and it's",isDeveloper,".I am going to be a Designer -", goingToBeDesigner);
console.log(`Hey it's me <${myName}>. I am <${age}> years old. You can contact me by this <${email}>. I am a Developer and it's <${isDeveloper}>. I am going to be a Designer - ${goingToBeDesigner}
`);

// Exercise 3:
var myname1="emran";
var myname1 ="Abir"
console.log(myname1);

// let myname2 ="kabir"
// myname2 = "rahim" 
// let myname2 ="Amin"
// console.log(myname2);

// Explaination :we can easily redeclare variable and reassigned value in 'var'. In 'let' we can not redeclare variable but reassigned the value, so when
// we want to redechare the variable it throws an error. And finally we can declare and assigned variable only one in 'const'. If we want to redeclare or 
// reassigned variable it throws an error

// Exercise 4:
 let myname = undefined;
 const ages = null;
// In JS the null and undefined datatypes are primitive And their values also primitive. null is set by the user but undefined is set by the Javascript. 
// but undefined set by the user is not good practice.

//  Exercise 5:
//  NaN is the abbroviation of Not a Number That means is not a number type. but it is actually a special numeric value in JavaScript that represents an
//  invalid or unrepresentable number. It appears when a mathematical operation fails to produce a valid number. That means a user wants to add two
//  number but one input is string. it throws NaN.And the type of NaN is number


// Exercise 6:
let thing;
console.log(thing);

// here the variable which has no value it returns undefined value because when the variable has no data javascript throws an undefined value. undefined
// value means the variable has no value yet.
